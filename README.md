<h1>Candy Land</h1>

<h4>Game Instructions:</h4>
Pick the number of players on the landing page. Then roll the dice to move each player around the board. When a player lands on a special space, the character will instruct the player to either move forward some spaces or loose a turn. Whichever player that reaches the Candy King first, is the winner.

<h4>Approach:</h4>
I first created the board background in Photoshop. Then I created the game board using divs with rows and cells. Then I colored the squares using an array of colors. Then I created a game piece for player 1 and started to move the piece around the board. After I had the board fully created, I started making the special spaces for the characters. After I made all the characters, and animations associated with the special spaces, I added all 4 players. Next I created the landing page with the number of players picker. 


<h4>Unsolved Problems:</h4>
I could spend several more days trying to get the Media Queries to work properly. They are not functional in the way I want them to look.
